Peel and finely chop 1 medium onion and mince 2 cloves of garlic. Have 4 cups of vegetable broth ready.|2. **Heat the Oil**: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Ensure the oil is shimmering but not smoking.|3. **Sauté the Onions**: Add the chopped onion to the pot. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until the onions become translucent and slightly softened, about 5 minutes. This releases their sweetness.|4. **Add Garlic**: Stir in the minced garlic cloves.

Bring the mixture to a rolling boil.|6. **Simmer the Soup**: Reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the soup simmer for 20 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the tomatoes to soften completely.|7. **Blend the Soup**: Remove the pot from the heat. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup directly in the pot until it is completely smooth and creamy. Alternatively, you can transfer the soup to a regular blender in batches, being careful to avoid hot splashes.|8. **Season to Taste**: Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Start with a small amount and adjust as needed. You can also add a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes.|9. **Optional: Add Fresh Herbs**: If desired, stir in 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh basil or parsley for added flavor and freshness. Let it simmer for another 2-3 minutes.|10. **Serve Hot**: Ladle the hot tomato soup into bowls. Garnish with a swirl of cream or a sprinkle of croutons if desired. Serve immediately and enjoy."
